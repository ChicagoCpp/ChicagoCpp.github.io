# C++'s Super Power

## Presenter: Matt Godbolt

We all know that C++ is a large and complex programming language. It’s become fashionable to publicize its shortcomings, but in this talk Matt wants to concentrate on the very best feature of C++ - its Superpower!
During this talk we’ll learn what C++’s Superpower is (which may surprise you!), after looking at some possible contenders. We’ll then explore the superpower through a hobby project of Matt’s, covering lots of both older and modern C++ concepts, and how one can migrate older code to new styles.
We’ll see how the Superpower has shaped C++ past, current and will continue to shape its future as a programming language, and why that’s really important in our day-to-day jobs as C++ developers.
