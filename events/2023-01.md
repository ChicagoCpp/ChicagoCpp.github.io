# Defining Range Formatting

## Presenter: Barry Revzin

C++20 introduced a new facility for formatting strings. It also introduced ranges. 
However, formatting or printing ranges of values remains... obnoxious in 
out-of-the-box C++. Enter: Barry Revzin. Barry is leading the charge to bring the 
simplicity of libfmt's fmt::format() facility for ranges to the standard library. 
And he's here to give us the bloody and exciting details on what that is and what 
it means to us and our future code.
