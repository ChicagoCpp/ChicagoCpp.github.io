# How to "OO" in C++

## Presenter: Mike Spertus

C++ has many ways to implement polymorphism: Inheritance and virtual functions, static polymorphism, concept-based polymorphism, 
the visitor pattern, variants and overloaded, etc. While this is very powerful, it can also be very confusing 
(after all, many languages are "one size fits all"). In this talk, Mike will explain and demonstrate each approach, including 
how to use it and why it exists, and then provide a framework for deciding which one to use in your code. 
He will also explain why "OO" is in quotation marks.
