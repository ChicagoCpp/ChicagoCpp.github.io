# C++ for the Cloud

## Presenter: Michael Spertus

The cloud is revolutionizing scalable and distributed computing but is difficult to take advantage of in C++. While cloud functions can scale up to unlimited concurrency, calling them takes dozens of lines of complex C++ code. While NoSQL databases are ubiquitous associative containers, they cannot be used in STL algorithms, and so forth.

What if we could make cloud functions nearly as easy to use as thread functions, NoSQL databases similarly to other associative containers, and do the same for other cloud services as well? You don't just have to imagine it. In this talk, Michael will show how you can take advantage of the cloud with simple and natural C++.

## About the Presenter

Michael is the CTO of Enklu building out AR technologies in Chicago, as well as a Full Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago.

Before joining Enklu, Michael was a Senior Principal Engineer in Amazon's Development Tools group, putting C++ in the cloud. Prior to this, he was a Fellow, VP at Symantec, the world’s largest Cybersecurity firm, where he led the development of a wide array of cybersecurity technologies including a major anti-rootkit technology now protecting over one hundred million computers and Symantec’s Authoritative Data Lake, one of the world’s largest security data lakes that was use to discover the Russian Dragonfly attack on the US energy grid.

Mike has been involved with programming languages since the 1980s when he helped write one of the first commercial C compilers for the original IBM PC and is a long-time member of the ANSI/ISO C++ Standards Committee, where he has contributed over 50 standards proposals, several of which are now important parts of the C++ language. He has spoken frequently in both Academic and Industry settings, including Invited Keynotes at the Shanghai and Beijing C++ Summits, Best Poster award at CPPCon 2017, and many others. He is a member of the board of directors at the Spertus Institute.
