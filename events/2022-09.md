# Poor Man’s Introspection and Reflection in C++: Effective Pointer-to-Member Use

Pointer-to-member for data members and member functions are an underused construct in C++, 
but they can be employed to allow one to “visit” the members of a class in an organized 
fashion. They can provide some of the facilities that are available natively in other 
languages, namely a form of introspection (where a class instance can describe itself) 
and reflection (where a class instance can be mutated by means of its description). 
With some modern C++ techniques, this can be done in an minimally invasive way 
(you don’t have to alter the reflected class necessarily) with a reasonable syntax so 
that it looks as though it had been designed into the language intentionally. It is 
useful for creating, serializers and deserializers, automated testing, and more.
