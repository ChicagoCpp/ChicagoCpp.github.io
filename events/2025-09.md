# 42 Years Of Teaching C And C++

## Presenter: Jay Shachter

Most members of the Chicago C/C++ Users' Group are programmers, or trying to find jobs as programmers, but it is possible to earn a living from C and C++ in other ways. Jay Shachter (who was the Organizer of the CCUG for 11 years, until he stepped down at the end of 2023) has been a professional instructor for most of his career, earning his living teaching classes in computer programming and system administration, and he has many amusing or otherwise interesting stories to tell from his 40-year career. Jay was working at Bell Labs when Bjarne Stroustrup was inventing C++, so he was present at the creation ("I remember the 'overload' keyword!", he likes to say, even though no one knows what he is talking about). This will not be a technical presentation, just a telling of stories, and non-technical people are welcome to attend.

## About the Presenter

Long-time members of the CCUG will observe that it has become something of a custom for Jay to give this talk every 5 years; and those of you who attended his last two talks will hear stories that you have heard before, but you might enjoy hearing them again, and there are always new tales to tell. We look forward to seeing you, at this opening talk of the new season!
