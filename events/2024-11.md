# Stack Tracing in C++

## Presenter: Jeremy Rifkin

A technical deep-dive into how stack traces are done in C++, ranging from walking stack frames to reversing runtime address randomization to making sense of debug symbols. This talk will explore utilizing stack traces in C++ to improve debuggability and diagnostics as well as explore how to collect stack traces in signal handlers and stack traces from C++ exceptions.
