# Preparing to Launch: Moving from College to Career (A Panel Discussion)

Transitioning from college to professional life involves many people with varied motivations 
and experiences. We're gathering a variety of people involved in the process to discuss this 
transition and all its challenges. Join us for a special evening to celebrate some of 
Chicago's development interns as well as a few industry professionals as we dig into the 
college-to-career transition, what it looks like after CovID, how the community might better 
enable it, and how it has otherwise changed over the years.
